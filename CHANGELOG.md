# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — Unreleased

Pre-release scaffolding. Under active development on `develop` branch.

- add: wizard step 2 and `gor-mobile repair` now run `android init` when
  the `android` binary is on `PATH`. This drops the official Google
  `android-cli` skill into `~/.claude/skills/android-cli/SKILL.md`, so
  Claude gets the full command reference in-session instead of only the
  binary being detected. `gor-mobile doctor` now surfaces a warning when
  the skill is missing but the CLI is installed. Existing users: run
  `gor-mobile repair`.
- add: when the `android` binary is absent, wizard step 2 now offers to
  run Google's official installer
  (`curl -fsSL https://dl.google.com/android/cli/latest/darwin_arm64/install.sh | bash`)
  instead of just opening the install page in a browser. The installer
  drops a ~5 MB launcher into `/usr/local/bin/android` (may prompt for
  sudo) and the launcher lazily fetches the full CLI on first run. Under
  `--yes` install proceeds without prompt; under `--dry-run` the command
  is printed but not executed. Auto-install is supported on ARM macOS and
  x86_64 Linux; other platforms get a manual-install note pointing to
  https://developer.android.com/tools/agents. The "Android CLI missing"
  note now includes a `Learn more:` link so users know what they're
  installing before they accept.
- add: `gor-mobile update` now also runs `android update` when the CLI
  is on `PATH`, so a single `gor-mobile update` keeps the rules pack, the
  Android CLI launcher, and gor-mobile's managed files (skills, agents,
  hooks, CLAUDE.md section) in sync.
- add: `gor-mobile uninstall` now prompts at the end whether to also
  remove the Android CLI. If confirmed, it removes the launcher
  (`/usr/local/bin/android`, sudo-escalates if needed), the cached full
  CLI (`~/.android/bin/android-cli`), the CLI cache
  (`~/.android/cli/`), and the `android-cli` skill
  (`~/.claude/skills/android-cli/`). Shared Android SDK state in
  `~/.android/` (avd, adbkey, cache, …) is intentionally left untouched.
  Under `--yes` the Android CLI is **not** removed (no implicit sudo).
- remove: google-dev-knowledge MCP registration step from the wizard. Docs
  lookup now relies on the `android` CLI + `gor-mobile docs`. Existing
  users: run `gor-mobile repair` — it will prune the managed entry from
  `~/.claude/mcp.json`.
